# Instabot
A simple python project to automatically give a certain number of likes to a certain user or hashtag from one's own account.


For the bot to work, a current Python version with pip must be installed.
You also need the Chrome browser and the WebDriver for Chrome, which can be downloaded from "chromedriver.chromium.org".
The WebDriver should be saved under "C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver.exe". If you save the Chromedriver in a different path, you have to change the path in the script.
You also need Selenium, which can be easily installed with the command "pip install selenium".

When InstabotApp.py is executed, a browser window opens and a GUI in which the user's own user name and password can be entered, as well as the desired account or hashtag and the number of likes.
After confirming twice with "Ok", the bot runs.
